# tester

This Package provides various useful Functions which help in writing Tests.

This Package provides a convenient Way to compare Values and check Errors. When the Comparison fails, it shows not only the two Values which failed, but also a 'Diff' (Difference) between them. As opposed to many existing Golang Libraries in the Internet, this Package uses the Object-Oriented Programming Style (O.O.P.) as in such mature Programming Languages as C++ and C#.
